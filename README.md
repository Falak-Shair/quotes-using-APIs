# quotes-using-APIs
I  build a Kanye quote machine. This is what it's look like

These are real Kanye quotes. So every time you click on this button which has a Kanye emoji, you see he'll say different things.

And some of the things he says are incredibly deep and other things are a little bit weird. All I want you to do is to figure out how to use the API which is at kanye.rest
